## Overview

 This code is for MLP(a type of classical neuron network), which don't use the tensorflow. That means you can change the back propagation process by yourself, or as you wish. for example, if you get an experimental function or rule for weight change , you can directly use it in this code.



1. **test.py** is the trriger, you can start the whole code from here. Also, you can change your paramaters for  the network.
2. recommend you use the **network2.py** . pay attention to the function ***backprop(self, x,y)***, this is the place that you can apply your own weight-change-rule. 
3. the code has very clear annotation, you can easily understand it.
